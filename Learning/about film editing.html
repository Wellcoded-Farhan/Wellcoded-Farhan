        <h2>Rhythm and Pacing:</h2>
        <p>Editing is often described as the "invisible art" because when done seamlessly, it goes unnoticed by the audience. Editors control the rhythm and pacing of a film, determining how long shots linger or how quickly they transition. This rhythm influences the overall mood and impact of the film.</p>
        <h2>Continuity and Montage:</h2>
        <p>Editors ensure continuity by maintaining consistent spatial relationships, eyelines, and actions across different shots. They also use montage techniques, which involve the juxtaposition of images to convey information, evoke emotions, or create meaning. Montage can be used for various effects, such as compressing time, showing character development, or building tension.</p>
        <h2>Emotional Impact:</h2>
        <p>Effective film editing can significantly enhance the emotional impact of a scene. The choice of when to cut, the duration of shots, and the use of close-ups, wide shots, and other framing techniques can evoke specific emotions in the audience. Editors collaborate closely with directors to align the editing style with the intended emotional tone of the film.</p>
        <h2>Customer Satisfaction:</h2>
